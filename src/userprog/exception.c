/*How page fault handler works? 
The kernel raises a page fault exception when a process accesses a page that is not in memory. The page fault is serviced as follows:-
1. The page fault handler first retrieves the address of the faulting page from one of the CPU control registers.
2. If the page is unmapped, that is, if there’s no data there, or if the page lies within kernel virtual memory, or if the access is an attempt to write to a read-only page, then the access is invalid. Any invalid access terminates the process and thereby frees all of its resources.
￼￼29
3. If the memory reference is valid, the frame table entry associated with the page that has faulted is obtained.
4. The frame table entry is used to locate the data that goes in the page, which might be in the file system, or in a swap slot, or it might simply be an all-zero page, or it might already be swapped into the memory by another process, which shares that page.
5. If the frame is already present in the memory (swapped in by a process that shares the page), then the frame only needs to be located. Otherwise, a new frame is obtained to store the page. And when all the memory has been exhausted, a frame must be made available by evicting some victim frame, chosen by the eviction algorithm.
6. Next, the data is fetched into the frame, by
a. Reading it from the file system or a swap slot if the frame is on the disk.
b. Zeroing it out if the frame table entry indicates that it is an all-zero page.
If the frame is already available in memory as a page of another process sharing
this page, then no action is necessary in this step.
7. The page table entry (PTE) of the page and all its aliases will be updated to
indicate that the page and its aliases are now available in memory.
8. The process is put back into the ready queue, so that it can resume execution from
the faulting instruction, when it is next scheduled to run.*/
